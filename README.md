# cookbook
a cookbook for me as beginner


## languages
Each language has its own folder


## warning
Do not edit submodule. If you would like to do it, clone it to seperate folder outside cookbook.

## 0 folder
It is used for testing a code before put it to the related folder through GitHub web. Folow then with `git submodule foreach git pull` if you update some submodule.
